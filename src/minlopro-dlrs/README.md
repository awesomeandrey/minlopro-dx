## Trigger Handler Framework Compatibility

DLRS mandates that new Apex Triggers should be deployed to the environment. Such Apex Triggers are auto-generated by DRLS on rollup configuration page. Such triggers typically have `dlrs_` pseudo-prefix.
To follow 'one-trigger-per-object' best practice, the DLRS triggers are still generated, but deployed as **inactive**.
